# SaladGenerator

## Background
This is the first piece of code I wrote when I began learning Swift. The intention was to generate a salad randomly from a list of ingredients that could be edited based on personal tastes.

## How to use it
To generate a salad, use the `salad()` function to print a salad to the console. You can change what ingredients are used by adding or removing ingredient names from the various arrays.
